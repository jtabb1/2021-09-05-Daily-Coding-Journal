    <p> 
      Yesterday I went to my Amazon job, thought about my 
      non-Amazon job, read two (Flatiron School) assignments, 
      and did two straight-forward problem sets. 
    </p>

    <p>
      This morning I did partially read one assignment and I 
      did one straight-forward problem set.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today I plan to work on Flatiron school assignments 
      and work on my non-Amazon job.
